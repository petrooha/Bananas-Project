Introduction
For this project, I needed to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.
 
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
•	0 - move forward.
•	1 - move backward.
•	2 - turn left.
•	3 - turn right.
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Gym

Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.

Gym currently has two pieces of documentation: the [documentation website](http://gym.openai.com) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/FAQ). A new and more comprehensive documentation website is in the works.

## Installation

To install the base Gym library, use `pip install gym`.

This does not include dependencies for all families of environments (there's a massive number, and some can be problematic to install on certain systems). You can install these dependencies for one family like `pip install gym[atari]` or use `pip install pettingzoo[gym]` to install all dependencies.

We support Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 on Linux and macOS. We will accept PRs related to Windows, but do not officially support it.

## API

The Gym API's API models environments as simple Python `env` classes. Creating environment instances and interacting with them is very simple- here's an example using the "CartPole-v1" environment:

```python
import gym 
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# env is created, now we can use it: 
for episode in range(10): 
    obs = env.reset()
    for step in range(50):
        action = env.action_space.sample()  # or given a custom model, action = policy(observation)
        nobs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

## Notable Related Libraries

* [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) is a learning library based on the Gym API. It is our recommendation for beginners who want to start learning things quickly.
* [RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo) builds upon SB3, containing optimal hyperparameters for Gym environments as well as code to easily find new ones. Such tuning is almost always required.
* The [Autonomous Learning Library](https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library) and [Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou) are two reinforcement learning libraries I like that are generally geared towards more experienced users.
* [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo) is like Gym, but for environments with multiple agents.
* [SuperSuit](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/SuperSuit) contains preprocessing wrappers for Gym and PettingZoo environments.

## Environment Versioning

Gym keeps strict versioning for reproducibility reasons. All environments end in a suffix like "\_v0".  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion.

## Citation

A whitepaper from when OpenAI Gym just came out is available https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01540, and can be cited with the following bibtex entry:

```

  Eprint = {arXiv:1606.01540},
}
```

## Release Notes

There used to be release notes for all the new Gym versions here. New release notes are being moved to [releases page](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases) on GitHub, like most other libraries do. Old notes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/31be35ecd460f670f0c4b653a14c9996b7facc6c/README.rst).
